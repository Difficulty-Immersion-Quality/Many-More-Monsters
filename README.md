# Many More Monsters
## 1
- It's not clear to me at face value if this should be implemented properly just yet.
- Crechelands.lua 629-733 --Dawnmaster Execution
- Status_BOOST.txt - "MMM_DAWNMASTERFLAMESTRIKE", "MMM_DAWNMASTERSUNBEAM", "MMM_DAWNMASTERGENERIC" & "MMM_LATHANDERSBLESSING" 
- // TODO: "IsInvulnerableVisible" is a StatusPropertyFlags but it was listed in the following 4 entries as a Boosts and were non-functional.
## 2
- Status_BOOST.txt - "MMM_BLESSINGOFRAVENQUEEN" 
- // TODO: Now grants Resistance to non-magical Bludgeoning, Piercing and Slashing damage per the description (but it's not quite clear to me what the intention of it is just at this moment.)
## 3
- Oof falling over out of the turn order is something most players find to be problematic.
## 4
- The bugbear outside the druid undercroft can kill Sazza when she exits, he should just be removed.
## 5
- Mini Grym pet is a bit too strong in combat, definitely needs a nerf or maybe just being a novelty that patrols camp.
- His audio is way too loud too, will need custom model or some such instead of just downscaling

# Many More Monsters - Revised (I dunno what we're calling it, the "lighter" fork for UNSO/Lab/DIQ and such)
## 1
- The MMM NPCs end up bloated with features and HP when used alongside CX/Lab, should bring them back to something closer to vanilla, slightly cleaner slates for modification.
## 2
- Encounters a little too dense in the early game and a couple could be removed.
